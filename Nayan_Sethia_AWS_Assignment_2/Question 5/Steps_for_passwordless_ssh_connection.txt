Steps to create paswwordless ssh between two ec2 instances

1. create two EC2 instances in the same subnet and with default security group.
2. Get connected to the created ec2 instances spearately 
3.Create your SSH key pair on source machine. This is machine from which you will be doing password less SSH to destination machine.
4. The command will be as follows:
    ssh-keygen -t rsa
5. After running this command terminal will let us know where the id_rsa and id_rsa.pub are residing. id_rsa is the private key that will remain on this server while id_rsa.pub is the public key that will be in destination folder
5. Now it is required to copy the public key to destination machine
6. Now, we need to copy id_rsa.pub key on destination machine. It should be copied to home directory of intended user in destination server. It should reside under ~/.ssh/ (i.e. home directory/.ssh/) and with name authorized_keys.
7. Here are the commands:
      cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh <user>@<ip_address> 'cat>> .ssh/authorized_keys'
8. This will copy the public key into the destination machine and hence the connection is done.
Now we can verify is by trying ssh from source to destination
